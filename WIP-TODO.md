- create an otf version of the font
- then use `fontforge -script ./icon_patcher/icon-patcher.py ./dist/iosevka-custom/otf/iosevka-custom-regular.otf --quiet` to patch in icons
- problem1: can't auto generate .otft
- problem2: can't combine all .ttf's into one .otf with icons
- problem3: the generated otf doesnt have all the icons
- problem4: why does not using `--quiet` cause an error
